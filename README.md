# PowerShell-Cybersecurity-VRS  
## Vale Rocha's Cybersecurity Repository

Welcome! This is my personal repository for career-related materials.

Here, I’ll be uploading everything I encounter in my Cybersecurity class. The goal is to create a centralized space for everything I’ve learned so far—both as a personal archive and as a way to share my progress.

The initial files include the first exercises we completed in class and at home. These cover basic tasks designed to help us get familiar with PowerShell, PowerShell ISE, and virtual machine environments. You’ll also find some basic analysis of my system’s data (which has now been anonymized).

## ❌ Mistakes

Needless to say, I’ve made tons of mistakes—and I’ll keep making them! That’s why some scripts or text files might seem long: I spent a lot of time debugging, correcting, and learning from them.  
If you're reading this: I'm here to learn, and I’ll keep doing my best.

## 📜 Included Scripts

So far:

## PHASE 1 (Ej1-Ej6, including Auditoria_Basica and VR_01)

1. **CMD Introduction**
   > Basic command-line analysis and familiarization.
2. **PowerShell Basics**
   > First steps and commands in PowerShell.
3. **Linux VM Execution**
   > Running a virtual Linux machine with verification procedures and basic Bash commands.
4. **Logic Operations in PowerShell ISE**
   > Using loops and file filtering to detect memory usage.
5. **Functions & Error Handling**
   > Verifying file existence with PowerShell ISE and managing mistakes.
6. **Service Analysis**
   > Exploring modules and manifests in both PowerShell and PowerShell ISE.
7. **Shell Scripting**
   > Entering Bash and doing some basic analyisis of users, services and files.

## PHASE II (Ej17)

1. **Use of the Have I Been Pwned? API**  
   This script checks whether any email address has been compromised using the [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) API.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT

To run the Python script correctly, you must include a text file named `apikey.txt` in the same directory. This file should contain your personal API key.

**Example content of `apikey.txt`: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

> 🔐 **Do not share your API key publicly.**  
> This key is private and should be kept secure to prevent unauthorized use.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

So far, I’ve learned a lot about basic security practices—like checking files, monitoring open ports, and analyzing memory usage.  
While it’s still an introduction to the cybersecurity world, I’m slowly getting more comfortable with these concepts.

I also see this repository as a personal timeline to track my growth and progress.
